# Theme Managment Accelerator - Adaptable Components

Adaptable Components are an integral part of your application, sourced from Material UI, and they offer a dynamic and flexible user interface (UI). These components are designed to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and device types, providing a consistent and responsive user experience.

## Custom CSS

In addition to Material UI's predefined CSS classes, you have the flexibility to apply custom CSS styles to these components. You can use custom CSS to override or extend the default styles provided by Material UI. This allows you to create a unique and branded appearance for your application's UI components.

## CSS Classes Generation

Each Material UI component comes with its own CSS file, and your application automatically generates some classes that correspond to these components. These generated classes provide a starting point for your CSS customization efforts.

By combining the power of Material UI's adaptable components with custom CSS, you can achieve a highly personalized and visually appealing user interface for your application. This combination of flexibility and control ensures that your application can adapt to various screen sizes and device types while maintaining a consistent and visually pleasing design.
