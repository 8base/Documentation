# Data Settings

You can change the name and description of tables in the 8base console. You can also create [Table Indexes](data-table-indexes.md), which can improve the speed of your data retrieval operations.

To open table settings, click **Data** in the sidebar, select the table you want to work on, and then click the ![gear](../../_images/_icons/ic_gear_disabled.svg) tab.
