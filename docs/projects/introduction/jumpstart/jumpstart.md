# Jumpstart your project with accelerators

Welcome to the 8base Accelerators documentation. Accelerators are pre-packaged functionalities that work inside of 8baseâ€™s low-code tools to help you jumpstart your application development. accelerators work to facilitate common elements of software applications such as authentication, navigation, user management and more.

## Naming Convention for Accelerators

At 8base, we follow a consistent naming convention for all states, requests, functions, and pages to make your development process smoother and more organized. Our convention is as follows:

- **Authentication (Auth)**: Identifier for Authentication related components.
- **Navigation (Nav)**: Identifier for Navigation components.
- **User Management (User)**: Identifier for User Management components.
- **Theme Management (Theme)**: Identifier for Theme Management components.

Each accelerator's identifier is prefixed with "acc," followed by the accelerator's identifier, and then the name of the specific function, request, state, or page. Here's an example:

- `accAuthLogin`: A function related to the Authentication accelerator's login functionality.
- `accNavSidebarGroups`: A state related to the Navigation accelerator's sidebar groups.

This naming convention helps you easily identify and manage various components within your project.
