# Binding a Request to a Looper

This example will demonstrate how to access data in a **Request** for use in a *Looper* component.

You will need a Page with no content and a **Request** called "queryUserList" that contains an array of objects with the following properties: **firstName**, **lastName**, **email**, **media**, **birthdate**, and **team**.

1. Set the Viewport size to 926; this can be found at the top of the application builder.
2. Select a *Header* component from the **Layout** section of the Components pane and drag it onto your page. 
3. Click the *Styles* tab in the right-hand pane and set the *grid* icon under **Background Color** to `#dfb94`.
4. Select a *Heading* component from the **Common** section of the Components pane and drag it onto your *Header*.
5. Enter "Fantasy Sports Pool" into the **Text** field and set the drop-down in the **Tag** field to H3 on the *Properties* pane.
6. Click the *Styles* pane and set the drop-down in the **Variant** field to H3.
7. Check that the **Font Color** is set to Initial and the **Align** is set to Inherit.
8. Expand the **Typography** section and set the **Color** to `#ffffff`.
9. Select a *Container* component from the **Common** section of the Components pane and drag it onto your Page.
10. At the top of the *Properties* pane to the right of the arrow, enter "Users" as the container name.
11. Click the *Styles* tab in the right-hand pane and set the **Display** to Flex and the **Direction** to column (the down arrow).
12. Expand the **Flex Child** section and set **Flex Grow** and **Flex Shrink** to 1.
13. Expand the **Size** section and set the **Height** to 100 px.
14. Select another *Container* component from the **Common** section of the Components pane and drag it onto your first *Container*.
15. Click the *Styles* tab in the right-hand pane and set the **Display** to Flex.
16. Expand the **Size** section and set the **Width** to 100%.
17. Expand the **Border** section and click the large button with a rectangle; this allows you to independently set properties on the Top, Right, Bottom, and Left borders.
18. Click the gear icon next to the **Bottom** item to open the settings pop-out.
19. Set the **Style** to solid, the **Width** to 4, and the **Color** to `#f5b609`, and click "x" to close the pop-out.
20. Select a *Heading* component from the **Common** section of the Components pane and drag it onto your second *Container*.
21. Enter "Users" into the **Text** field and set the drop-down in the **Tag** field to H3 on the *Properties* pane.
22. Click the *Styles* pane and set the drop-down in the **Variant** field to H3.
