# Application File Uploads

For React developers 8base provides an open source `@8base-react/file-input` package that wraps Filestack picker and makes it easy to include file uploading in your application. The file picker comes with ability to upload files from user's computer, a URL, Google Drive, Facebook, Dropbox and other sources as well cropping and rotating images.
