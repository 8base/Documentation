# Language
The *Language* property identifies the language of a component.

The lang attribute will not be added to the component, if the *Language* property is empty.

For more detail on the *Language* property, see the [Mozilla developer docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang).
