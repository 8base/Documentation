# Organizations Overview

The list of your organizations is displayed on the left sidebar of the 8base Home. Clicking an organization brings you to the **Organization Home**. Here, you will find a description, a list of available projects, and access to settings and team management tools.

There are three main sections: **General**, **Team**, and **Billing**.

### General

**General** displays the organization name, description, category, and Organization ID. Your Organization ID is used for support queries. 

Administrators and the Owner can edit the organization name, description, and icon. When you change the name or description, remember to click **Save Changes**.

Click the organization icon on the left to change the icon. If you have never added an icon, a blank folder will display.
