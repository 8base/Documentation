## Getting to know App Builder

While App Builder abstracts into interface most application development concepts that traditionally get handled using syntax, it still allows developers to write and run JavaScript code. Developers can also manipulate and store data and trigger events and actions on application user interactions and different stages in the application lifecycle, like routing.
