# Who Uses 8base?

8base is designed for use by professional developers who understand the intricacies of today's digital landscape and the importance of rapid development cycles. 

## Prerequisites for an 8base Developer

- **JavaScript Proficiency**: At the heart of 8base's functionality is JavaScript. A solid grasp of this language is essential to harness the full potential of the platform. Whether you're writing custom functions, using handlebar expressions almost anywhere, integrating third-party services, or manipulating data, JavaScript is your primary language.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Knowledge**: A basic understanding of the principles of OOP is helpful when using 8base. 8base's enables the concept of objects extensively throughout the Platform.
- **Familiarity with GraphQL (Recommended)**: While not a strict requirement, having knowledge of GraphQL can be a significant advantage. 8base’s Backend enables a powerful GraphQL API, allowing for efficient and flexible data retrieval and manipulation.

## Why Professional Developers Choose 8base

- **Rapid Development**: 8base's low-code environment means that developers can quickly build applications, integrate services, and deploy solutions. This rapid development capability ensures that projects move from concept to production in record time.
- **Flexibility & Control**: Unlike other low-code platforms, 8base does not box developers into a rigid framework. Developers have the freedom to customize, extend, and integrate as they see fit, ensuring that the platform adapts to its users’ needs rather than the other way around.
- **Scalability**: With 8base, developers don't have to compromise on scalability. The platform is built to handle the demands of growing applications, ensuring that as developers’ user bases expand, application remains responsive and efficient. Developers can use 8base to develop a prototype, MVP and/or fully-scalableable and secure production application.
- **Separation of backend, frontend and API layers**: Developers can choose to leverage 8base’s backend and/or frontend development tools while preserving the option to build custom frontend applications using their frontend development framework of choice. 

In summary, 8base is for the discerning developer who values radical productivity yet refuses to compromise on modern coding standards, flexibility and extensibility.

## What about Mobile Developers?
Mobile developers working Swift, Android or other native frontend framework or low-code tool utilize 8base’s simple to use and scalable Backend-as-a-Service and its powerful GraphQL API.

## What about Non-Developers?

Although non-developers benefit greatly from the use of 8base, the product itself is designed for professional developers. However, it’s common for non-develpers to use parts of 8base in collaboration with developers. For instance, making changes to a data model or simple changes to a user interface.
