# Popper
The *Popper* component displays content on top of other content. The component API is an alternative to the react-popper and relies on a 3rd party library, *Popper.js*, for perfect positioning.

When you add a *Popper* component to a page, a *Button* component that controls the state of the *Popper* is automatically added for you. Other components, such as an *Icon* or *Image*, can also be used.

## Unique Style Attributes
