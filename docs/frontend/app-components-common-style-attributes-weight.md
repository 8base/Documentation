# Weight
The *Weight* style attribute sets the weight or boldness of a text component. The values available will depend on the current font (font family) setting. 

For more detail on the *Weight* style attribute, see the [Mozilla developer docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/weight).
