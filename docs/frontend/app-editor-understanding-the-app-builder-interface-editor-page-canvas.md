# Editor Page Canvas

The Page Canvas is a WYSIWYG editor, meaning you can see how your app will look as you build it. To build your user interface, you can drag and drop components onto the Page Canvas.

## Layouts and Components

Most often, when developing an App in App Builder, your Pages will be built using a combination of *Layouts* and *Components*. 

Layouts and components help the developer reduce repetitive development tasks and speed up the development time. 

### Layouts

A *Layout* is a reusable container to arrange components on the Page Canvas. The App Builder has a few different Layouts, such as **Authenticated** and **Empty**. You can also create custom layouts.

### Components

A *Component* is a specific functionality you add to your layout or page. The App Builder has numerous pre-built components, such as **Menu**, **Header**, **Table**, **Date Picker**, **Icon**, and **Breadcrumbs**.

For more information on working with *Layouts* see "Creating and editing Layouts".
