# Container
The *Container* component centers your content horizontally. 

By default, a container component is *fluid*, and its width grows with the size of the screen. To create a *fixed* container, set the minWidth and maxWidth to the same value. 

For more detail on the *Container* component, see the [MUI developer docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-container/).
