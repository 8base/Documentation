# Main Modules and Capabilities

8base has been designed as a comprehensive platform to cater to the diverse needs of modern application development. Its modular approach ensures that developers have the tools they need at every stage of the application lifecycle. Below is a description of the modules and capabilities of 8base, providing an overview of how the platform is organized.

## 8base Home

8base Home serves as the central dashboard for all your 8base projects. It provides a holistic view of your applications, resources, and configurations. From here, you can navigate to other modules, manage user roles, and monitor application health.

Key Features:
- Centralized management of Projects.
- Quick access to other 8base modules.
- User role and permission management.

## Backend Builder

The Backend Builder is where the magic happens for your application's backend needs. It provides a visual interface to design, configure, and manage your database, serverless functions, and API endpoints.

Key Features:

- Visual database schema designer.
- Spreadsheet-like data viewinf and management interface.
- Serverless function management.
- Management of application core services such as authentication, role-based access controls and more.
- API endpoint configuration and testing.

Backend Builder can be accessed by selecting OPEN BACKEND from the Project Dashboard. This results in Backend Builder opening in another tab, allowing for easy navigation of concurrent 8base Home, Backend and Frontends even across multiple projects.

## App Builder

8base's App Builder is a visual tool designed for frontend development. It allows developers to design and build frontend web applications, integrate with the 8base backend and other APIs and data sources, and preview and deploy applications seamlessly.

Key Features:

- Drag-and-drop user interface designer.
- Rich component library.
- Integration with 8base backends, REST and GraphQL APIs and other data sources.
- IDE for authoring frontend functions and queries.
- Quick application preview and deploy.

App Builder can be accessed by selecting OPEN FRONTEND from the Project Dshboard. This results in App Builder opening in another tab, allowing for easy navigation of concurrent 8base Home, Backend and Frontends even across multiple projects.


## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

For developers who prefer working in a terminal or need to automate tasks, 8base offers a robust Command-Line Interface (CLI). The CLI provides a set of commands to manage, deploy, and interact with 8base projects directly from the command line.

Key Features:

- Project initialization and management.
- Deployment automation.
- Direct interaction with 8base services.

## SDK

The 8base Software Development Kit (SDK) is a collection of tools and libraries designed to simplify the integration of 8base services into your application. Whether you're building a web, mobile, or desktop application, the SDK provides the necessary functions to interact with 8base's backend seamlessly.

Key Features:

- Comprehensive API wrappers.
- Authentication and authorization helpers.
- Integration with popular frameworks and languages.

## Conclusion

8base's modular approach ensures that developers have a tailored experience, whether they're working on the frontend, backend, or anywhere in between. By understanding the main modules and their capabilities, you can harness the full power of 8base to build, deploy, and manage applications efficiently.
