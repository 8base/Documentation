# Combining Queries

In the following examples, we have a table called `Posts`, which contains fields and relations like `title`, `body`, `author`.

## Using multiple queries in a request

If multiple queries are combined into a single request, they get executed in parallel, the responses are collated and returned as a single response object. This lets you fetch objects of different and unrelated types in the same query.

<div class="code-sample">
<div>
<label>Request</label>

```javascript
query {
  /* A profile about the author */
  author(name: "Huxley") {
    posts {
      count
      items {
        title
      }
    }
  }

  /* A list of posts from other authors */
  postsList(filter: {
    author: {
      name: {
        not_equals: "Huxley"
      }
    }
  }) {
    items {
      title
    }
  }

  /* A list of others other than the huxley */
  authorsList(filter: {
    name: {
      not_equals: "Huxley"
    }
  }) {
    count
    items {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

</div>
<div>
<label>Response</label>

```json
{
  "data": {
    "author": {
      "posts": {
        "count": 2,
        "items": [
          {
