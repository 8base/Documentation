# Projects

Projects are the container or workspace where you can develop and manage your work. All 8base projects are managed via the 8base Management Console, a secure web portal requiring an 8base account and a modern web browser. 

Projects benefit from scalable server-less GraphQL API, fully managed MySQL Database hosted on AWS. You can leverage additional services like authentication, authorization, and file storage, all supported by the 8base team and community.
