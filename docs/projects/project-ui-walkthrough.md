# Project UI Walkthrough
This article walks you through the features accessible on the *Project Dashboard*.
_______

## Project Dashboard
The *Project Dashboard* is where you access everything related to your selected project. The screen is divided into a main page and a left-hand menu. You can access the most commonly used features from the main page or the menu.

### Main Page
The main page consists of your project's name, project information, access to manage project settings, and access to launch your project's backend and frontend applications.

	Legend: Application(s) (red border) | Information (black border) | Project Settings (blue border)
 
#### Backend Application
To launch your backend application, click the "Open" button on the project dashboard next to the backend name. The backend application opens in a new browser tab. Here you can view your application quotas, start building your data model, define functions, set up user roles, use the API explorer to create GraphQL queries, and get help from the 8base community.

#### Frontend Application
To launch your frontend application, click the "Open" button on the project dashboard next to the frontend name. The App Builder opens in a new browser tab, and you can now begin designing your frontend application.

![App Builder](./_images/projects-project-ui-walkthrough-app-builder.png)

If you have more than one frontend, click the down arrow next to the current frontend name, this displays a list of all your frontends. A link to add a new frontend is at the bottom of the list (see <a href="#adding-a-frontend">Adding a Frontend</a>).

Select the frontend you want to work with and click the "Open" button. The project builder opens in a new browser tab (as seen above).

#### All Environments
The project dashboard's *All Environments* area provides information about your project roles, authorization profiles, file storage size, and database information for your backend application. There will only be database information if you have a backend application.

### <a id="adding-a-frontend">Adding a Frontend</a>
You can add a new frontend from either the *Project Dashboard* or the *Frontends Listing* page.

**Start Flow A:** *Project Dashboard > Frontend Drop-down List*

Click the down arrow next to the current frontend name on the project dashboard. A list of all your frontends displays; click "Add New Frontend" at the bottom of the list.

**Start Flow B:** *Menu > Frontend Listing*

Click the *Frontends* link on the menu to open the *Frontend Listing* page. Click the "Add Frontend" button in the upper left corner of the page.

**Common Flow:**

A pop-up opens for you to input the **name** of your frontend and enable **integrated authentication** if required.

The following types of integrated authentication are available:
+ **No Authentication** - your project will not use authentication.
+ **Hosted Login** - a default 8base authentication profile is created for your project. 
+ **Coded Login** -  a default authentication profile along with Sign In and Sign Up pages are created for your project. 

**Note:** For an in depth discussion of how authentication works see the article on [Authentication](/projects/backend/8base-console-authentication.md).

![Add Frontend](./_images/projects-project-ui-walkthrough-create-new-frontend.png)

If you are adding integrated authentication for your project, select the type of authentication you want, and either select an existing authentication profile from the drop-down or "Add Auth Profile" to create a new one.

The authentication profile you selected will be used for all the GraphQL mutations in your Frontend(s).

![Add Authentication](./_images/projects-project-ui-walkthrough-create-new-frontend-integrated-auth.png)

Click the "Create" button to bring up the *Frontend Creator*, which steps through creating your new frontend. 

![Frontend Creator](./_images/projects-project-ui-walkthrough-create-new-frontend-creator.png)

The *Frontend Creator* completes the setup, and a new pop-up prompts you to set up your authentication *Template*. Click "OK" to close the pop-up.

![Add Frontend](./_images/projects-project-ui-walkthrough-create-new-frontend-existing-auth.png)

You can find instructions on how to set up your *Template* by clicking the **Help** icon at the top of the *Project Dashboard* or *Frontend Listing page* and selecting "View Template Instructions", which opens the 8base documentation site in a new browser.

**End Flow A:**

Your new frontend displays in the frontend drop-down list on the *Project Dashboard*.

![New Frontend List](./_images/projects-project-ui-walkthrough-dashboard-new-frontend-list.png)

**End Flow B:**

Your new frontend displays on the *Frontend Listing* page.
