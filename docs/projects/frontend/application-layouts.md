# Application Layouts

Layouts are reusable containers that you can use to arrange components on the Page Canvas. App Builder has some pre-configured Layouts, such as Authenticated and Empty. You can also create custom Layouts.

Layouts are not Page-specific and get selected on a page-by-page basis in the Page settings.
