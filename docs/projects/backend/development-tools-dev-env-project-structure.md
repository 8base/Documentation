# Project Structure

When you use the [8base CLI](/projects/backend/development-tools/cli) to create a new project with all of the default options, it will create a directory structure similar to this:

```text
Building a new project called ExampleProject ðŸš€

ExampleProject
â”œâ”€â”€ .workspace.json
â”œâ”€â”€ 8base.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ resolvers
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ resolver
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ handler.ts
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ mocks
    â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ request.json
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ schema.graphql
    â”œâ”€â”€ tasks
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ task
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ handler.ts
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ mocks
    â”‚           â””â”€â”€ request.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ triggers
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ trigger
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ handler.ts
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ mocks
    â”‚           â””â”€â”€ request.json
    â””â”€â”€ webhooks
        â””â”€â”€ webhook
            â”œâ”€â”€ handler.ts
            â””â”€â”€ mocks
                â””â”€â”€ request.json

All of the dependencies can be installed using `npm` or `yarn`. The 8base CLI comes with Webpack and TypeScript pre-configured. This allows you to write code in JavaScript or TypeScript in your custom functions, as well as use `async/await`.

Following this project structure is a best practice. Your work will stay organized and get the most out of 8base's CLI. For example, the CLI's [generator commands](/projects/backend/development-tools/cli/generators) are convenient for scaffolding new resources and will add generated files using the pattern seen above (`src/<functionType>/<functionName>/**/*`).

## Server vs Client

It is very common for developers to commit their server-side and client-side code to the same git repository. In such situations, we suggest cleanly seperating the two directories at the project's root level. This will prevent a number of errors that would otherwise occure when installing dependencies and deploying code.

Try using the following directory structure when committing server-side and client-side code to the same git repository:

```text
ExampleProject
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ client/
â””â”€â”€ server/
```
