# Flex Shrink
The *Flex Shrink* style attribute sets the shrink factor of a flex item. If the combined size of all flex items is larger than the container, items will shrink according to their flex shrink value.


For more detail on the *Flex Shrink* style attribute, see the [Mozilla developer docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-shrink).
