# Component Consistency

This article describes how developers can expect component properties and styles to be organized in the editor.

---

In App Builder, every component type has a dedicated editor that contains all the properties and styles specific to that component. This approach gives you full control over the look and feel of your app, without having to wade through unrelated options.

However, this can also lead to inconsistencies between different components if you're not careful. For example, the Button component has a "Text" property, while a Label component may have a "Caption" property.

To avoid confusion, we recommend that you take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the editor for each component type before starting to build your app. That way, you'll know exactly where to find the options you need.
