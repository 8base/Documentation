# Title
The *Title* property contains text that identifies the content in a component, iframe, or data table.

A title's primary purpose, when used as a label for an iframe, is to identify the element for assistive devices such as screen readers.  

For more information on the *Title* property, see the [Mozilla developer docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title).
