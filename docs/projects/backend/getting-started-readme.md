# Backend Overview

Every 8base Workspace contains the following components:

1. **Schema**: A Schema represents the shape of your application data and specifies what data a client application can query from your API, as well as how to manipulate it.
2. **System Data**: Data resources that are pre-defined by default for every 8base application, such as: [Project Team Management](../8basehome/projects/projects-team-management.md), Users, [Roles & Permissions](../backend/app-services/roles-and-permissions.md), and [Files](data/8base-console-handling-files.md).
3. **User Data**: All the unique data resources (tables, records, etc) that are specific to your application.
4. **Authentication and Authorization System**: Sign-up/Sign-in, manage, and authorization flows of your application. [Authentication](/backend//app-services/authentication) is implemented through [Authentication Profiles](/backend//app-services/authentication#authentication-types), while [Authorization](../backend/app-services/roles-and-permissions.md) uses the roles and permissions system.
5. **Workspace Users**: 8base users with access to your Workspace through the console.
6. [Custom Functions](/backend/custom-functions): For building and extending your application's server-side functionality.
7. **Integrations**: Data and functionalities from 3rd party sources.
8. [CI/CD](/projects/backend/development-tools/cli/ci-cd): The ability to create branched Workspace environments and a development pipeline.

## Workspaces

The structure of a Workspace can generally be divide into two parts:

### System Parts

- Schema
- System Data
- Custom Logic (Functions)
- Authentication Data
- Authorization (Roles and Permission)
- Workspace Settings

### User Parts

Application users and all the data created by them, contained in user data tables.
