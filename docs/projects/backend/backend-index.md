# Backend Development

**8base** is a Backend-as-a-Service. It lets front-end developers focus more on what they love and back-end developers expedite their workflow. 

When using 8base, your project benefits from having:

- A fully scalable server-less GraphQL API.
- A fully managed MySQL Database that's hosted on AWS ([Aurora MySQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/)).
- Ready-to-use app services (Authentication, Authorization, File Storage, and more)

The 8base Management Console is where you manage all backend resources, like Data Models, Roles and Permissions, Users, API Tokens, and more. It's a secure, easy-to-access and beautifully designed web portal that can be accessed from any computer, allowing teams to collaborate and build all types of applications.

To get started quickly with the 8base Management Console, all you'll need is [an 8base account](https://app.8base.com) and a web browser.
