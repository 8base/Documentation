# Introduction

This article describes how developers can connect to Data Sources (APIs) in App Builder.

A data source is an API client you can send requests to from your app to get data to your pages and interact with APIs. InApp Builder, all data sources get set up as a Resource in the left-side menu of the Editor. Currently, App Builder supports connecting to an API via REST or GraphQL, as well as an 8base Backend.
