# Grid Row End
The *Grid Row End* style attribute specifies a grid item's end position within a grid row. Grid lines, spans or the auto setting define an item's grid placement and set the inline-end edge of its grid area.

For more detail on the *Grid Row End* style attribute, see the [Mozilla developer docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-row-end).
