# Layout Components

Layout components help you organize and control your user interface.

- [Async Content](app-components-layout-components-async-content.md): The Async Content component is a progress indicator that displays an unspecified wait time or length of a process.
- [Card](app-components-layout-components-card.md): The Card component is a surface that displays content and actions for a single topic.
- [Container](app-components-layout-components-container.md): The Container component centers content horizontally and provides an area to lay out other components to create a unified page design.
- [Footer](app-components-layout-components-footer.md): The Footer component is a container that allows you to organize other components within it at the bottom of the page.
- [Header](app-components-layout-components-header.md): The Header component is a container that allows you to organize other components within it at the top of the page.
- [Menu](app-components-layout-components-menu.md): The Menu component displays a list of choices on a temporary surface. The user must interact with a button or another control to display a menu.
- [Paper](app-components-layout-components-paper.md): The Paper component translates the physical properties of paper to the screen. Paper components can be re-sized, shuffled, and bound together as multiple sheets.
- [Popper](app-components-layout-components-popper.md): The Popper component displays content on top of other content. The component API is an alternative to the react-popper and relies on a 3rd party library, Popper.js, for perfect positioning.
