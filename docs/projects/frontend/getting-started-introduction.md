# Getting Started

Learn how developers and teams can build, deploy, and evolve full-stack web applications using App Builder. Create great UX/UI experiences for user-facing and internal applications using App Builder's drag-and-drop components, and connect to REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, and other data sources, all while using intuitive UI tools and JavaScript.

## Getting to know App Builder

While App Builder abstracts into interface most application development concepts that traditionally get handled using syntax, it still allows developers to write and run JavaScript code. Developers can also manipulate and store data and trigger events and actions on application user interactions and different stages in the application lifecycle, like routing.
