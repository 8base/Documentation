# Data Viewer

While logged into a project's workspace, 8base provides an "Admin Panel" like interface for searching and managing table records. The _Data Viewer_ is located within the management console's _Data_ screen, tabbed alongside each table's _Schema_.

## Adding Records

New table records can be added using the "+" button next to the table name. A form modal will appear that displays all table fields. All validations specified in the schema definition are enforced while using the data viewer.

### Filtering Records

When using the Data Viewer, filters can be applied to reduce the number of records displayed. Multiple filters can be added and used together. Please note, the Data Viewer's filtering UI does not support filtering based on related tables.

Use the API Explorer for advanced table filtering.

### Sorting Records

Data records can be sorted by using one or more sortable attributes. Sort attributes are ranked in the order in which they were created. Additionally, filters can be applied to reduce the number of records displayed. Multiple filters can be added and used together. Please note, the Data Viewer's sorting UI does not support sorting based on related table values.

Use API Explorer for advanced table sorting.

### Selected Fields

By default, the _createdAt_, and _updatedAt_ field columns are hidden in the Data Viewer. In order to customize which fields and columns display for a given table, click on the `[Selected Fields]` drop-down and toggle on/off desired fields.

In the same drop-down, columns can easily be reordered. Simply drag-and-drop items in the drop-down to any preferred order.

### Importing Data

To import a CSV file, click the ellipsis button in the top right corner of the menu bar and choose `[Import CSV]` from the drop-down. The CSV importer supports column mapping and enforces all schema defined validations on create.

Please refer to the [CLI's Import](/projects/backend/development-tools/cli/commands#import) command docs to import more complex data (related records, images, smart fields, etc).
