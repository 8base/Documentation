Click "Cancel" to cancel adding the team member and close the notification.

Click "Continue" to send the invitation and close the notification. A confirmation message at the bottom of the *Team* page indicates the invitation was sent.

The next time you login and view the *Team* page, the new team member's name will be listed. Team members who have yet to accept an invitation have a status of *Pending*.
