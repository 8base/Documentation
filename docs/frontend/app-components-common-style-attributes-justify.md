# Justify
The *Justify* style attribute is available when the layout display selected is Flex. It defines the justify-self value on all items within a container and justifies all items as a group.

**Values:** Flex start, Flex end, Center, Space between and Space around.

For more detail on the *Justify* style attribute, see the [Mozilla developer docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-items).
