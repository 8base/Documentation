# Data Scopes for App Builder Requests

This article describes how developers can expect data scopes to be applied when working with Requests.

When working with App Builder Requests, developers can expect data scopes to be applied in the following way:

## Local Scope

If a Request is created within a Local namespace, that Request's state will be read-only accessible by only elements (Functions, Requests, and Components) contained within the same Local namespace (Page).

Additionally, the request will only have visibility to element states that expose their state to the same local namespace. Custom state entries are always read/write accessible, whereas most states created and managed by App Builder are always read-only.

## Global Scope

If a Request is created within the Global namespace, that Request's state will be read-only accessible by all App Builder elements, regardless of the namespace.

However, the Request will only have visibility to element states that are also Global namespaces. This can be easily conceptualized as a parent (Global) and child (Local) relationship, where the child has visibility into the parent while the parent doesn't have visibility of their children.

## Summary

To summarize, when working with Requests within App Builder, developers can expect data scopes to be applied in the following way:

- If a Request is created within a Local namespace, that Request's state will be read-only accessible by only elements (Functions, Requests, and Components) contained within the same Local namespace (Page).

- If a Request is created within the Global namespace, that Request's state will be read-only accessible by all App Builder elements, regardless of the namespace.
