# Backend Development

**8base** is a Backend-as-a-Service. It lets front-end developers focus more on what they love and back-end developers expedite their workflow. 

When using 8base, your project benefits from having:

- A fully scalable server-less GraphQL API.
- A fully managed MySQL Database that's hosted on AWS ([Aurora MySQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/)).
- Ready-to-use app services (Authentication, Authorization, File Storage, and more)
