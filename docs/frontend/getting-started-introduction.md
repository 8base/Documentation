# App Builder Docs

Learn how developers and teams can build, deploy, and evolve full-stack web applications using App Builder. Create great UX/UI experiences for user-facing and internal applications using App Builder's drag-and-drop components, and connect to REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, and other data sources, all while using intuitive UI tools and JavaScript. 

## Getting to know App Builder

While App Builder abstracts most application development concepts that traditionally get handled using syntax, it still allows developers to write and run JavaScript. Developers can also manipulate and store data and trigger events and actions on application user interactions and different stages in the lifecycle, like routing. 

Here is an overview of all the sections you can start diving into to become an App Builder expert!

## Connect to ANY Data Source

App Builder lets developers connect directly to any REST and GraphQL API from their application. By creating an API Client (a.k.a, _Resource_), developers can make requests and receive responses in their applications.
