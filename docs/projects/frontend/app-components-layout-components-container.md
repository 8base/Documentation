# Container

The *Container* component centers content horizontally and provides an area to lay out other components to create a unified page design.

By default, a container component is _fluid_, and its width grows with the size of the screen. To create a _fixed_ container, set the minWidth and maxWidth to the same value.

For more detail on the _Container_ component, see the [MUI developer docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-container/).
