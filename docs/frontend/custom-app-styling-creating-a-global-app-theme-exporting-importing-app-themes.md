# Exporting / Importing App Themes

This document describes exporting/importing App Themes.

![Responsive design in App Builder](./_images/ab-custom-styling-theme-import-export-1.png)

App Builder currently doesn't support the importing or exporting of a Theme. You can, however, manually add or copy your theme's custom `css`. This is available in the `Settings > Theme > Custom CSS` tab of the editor.

We recommend saving any custom CSS  in a separate file and using a tool like `git` for versioning control. This is also considered a best practice currently when writing custom CSS in media queries.

!>Adding Custom CSS to your App Builder project will result in those changes being applied globally.
