# Table Indexes

To improve look up performance on your tables, you can add one or more of your own indexes. This feature is found in the table settings.

You can select one or several fields in the table by which the index will be generated, as well as whether or not it should be a _Unique Index_. When naming the index, ensure the name does not contain spaces.
