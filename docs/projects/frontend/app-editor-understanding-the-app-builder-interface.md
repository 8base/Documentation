# Understanding the App Builder Interface

Learn about the different menus and canvases in App Builder.

- [Editor Header Menu Tools](app-editor-understanding-the-app-builder-interface-editor-header-menu-tools.md): The Header Menu is at the top of the interface, and has commands such as save, redo, preview, and deploy.
- [Editor Page Canvas](app-editor-understanding-the-app-builder-interface-editor-page-canvas.md): The Page Canvas is on the right-hand side. This is where you build your user interface. You can drag and drop components onto the canvas.
- [Editor Hidden Canvas](app-editor-understanding-the-app-builder-interface-editor-hidden-canvas.md): The Hidden Canvas area is used to build elements that only appear under certain circumstances, such as error dialog boxes.
- [Editor Components Drawer](app-editor-understanding-the-app-builder-interface-editor-components-drawer.md): The Component Drawer contains the Component Library and your Component Groups. These are the elements you drag onto the Page Canvas.
- [Editor Page Context menu](app-editor-understanding-the-app-builder-interface-editor-page-context-menu.md): The Page Context Menu is on the left, and contains your Pages, Requests, Functions, and more.
