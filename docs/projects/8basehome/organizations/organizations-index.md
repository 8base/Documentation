# Organizations

Organizations are for larger agencies and enterprises who work across multiple projects. All projects, environments, and teams are accessible under one umbrella. This eliminates the need for individual project-based access control. Roles and permissions can be adjusted simultaneously across members, projects, and backend environments.
